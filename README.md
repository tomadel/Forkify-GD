# Forkify-GD
The Forkify App is a web application that allows users to search for recipes using the Forkify API. As part of Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript course, I coded the JavaScript part of the application, implementing the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture for a clear separation of concerns and easy maintainability.

Leveraging the power of the Forkify API, users can search for recipes by entering keywords or ingredients, and filter the results based on various criteria such as cooking time, number of servings, and dietary restrictions. The app provides a detailed view of each recipe, including ingredients, preparation steps, and nutritional information.

Additionally, users can create their own recipes, which are stored in local storage, and edit or delete them as needed. The app also allows users to bookmark their favorite recipes for future reference.

Overall, my Forkify App provides an intuitive and efficient way for users to discover, create, and save recipes. The project was developed as part of Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript course, and the application's architecture follows the MVC pattern for optimal organization and scalability.
